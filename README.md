# hop.js
A JavaScript version of Hopscotch, the coding platform for kids

## Getting started
Simply click the "⬇️ Code" button at the top of the page to clone locally.

## How to use
It's easy! You can type native JS code to run inside the function, or <a href="https://github.com/redstone-scratch/hop.js/wiki">see the wiki</a> for the adapted versions of every block in Hopscotch.

## How it works
As of the time of writing this (Friday, September 4th in the Northern Hemisphere), it uses jQuery to respond to when the user clicks the Run button and does `eval()` on the script you wrote. But I plan to make a whole engine for writing to a JSON file that you can load, so you can save your projects.
